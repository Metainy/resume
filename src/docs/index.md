* <JobHeader :job='{ date: "2014 - 2015", title: "Android Developer", company: "Inmaa Solutions"}'></JobHeader>

  Even though my stay at Inmaa was short, I have learned so much during my stay.  
  I have been working with an amazing team to plan, develop, and maintain a health and fitness mobile application that
  copnnect users with medical professionals.  
  The application had multiple features including Q&A system, articles, and subscription-based system.


* <JobHeader :job='{ date: "2012 - 2017", title: "Co-Founder", company: "Max Bound"}'></JobHeader>

  Max Bound is a small automotive parts and accessories business. Even though it has nothing to do with the tech field,
  it was a huge step in my life.  
  I had to take on multiple roles to keep the business going, step out of my comfort zone, learn,
  and adapt to gain practical insights of how a small business can run and survive in an unforgiving market.

  We were also a wholesale supplier for various products, so we dealt with suppliers as clients on a daily basis as well
  as retail clients.

  I had lots of responsibilities and information to keep track of, managing revenue and budget, keep track of
  orders, taking decisions when it comes to stock control, and acting as a focal point of contact, but that didn't stop
  me from using my hobby at the time by creating various C# desktop applications that acts
  as helpers along with our POS system.
