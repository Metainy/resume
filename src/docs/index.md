## Education

* ### Bachelor in Management Information Systems

I mainly work as a remote freelance developer. However, this section focuses on giving you more insights on the entities
I have been associated with over the year.

* <JobHeader :job='{ date: "2014 - 2015", title: "Android Developer", company: "Inmaa Solutions"}'></JobHeader>

  Even though my stay at Inmaa was short, I have learned so much during my stay.  
  I have been working with an amazing team to design, develop and maintain a health and fitness mobile application that
  offers all soft of medical information and help, and act as a contact point between users and doctors.


* <JobHeader :job='{ date: "2012 - 2017", title: "Co-Founder", company: "Max Bound"}'></JobHeader>

  Max Bound is a small automotive parts and accessories business. Even though it has nothing to do with the tech field,
  it was a huge step in my life.  
  I had to take on multiple roles to keep the business going, step out of my comfort zone, learn
  and adapt in order to gain practical insights of how a small business can run and survive in an unforgiving market.

  We were also a wholesale supplier for various products, so we dealt with suppliers as clients on a daily basis as well
  as retail clients.

  I had lots of responsibilities and information to keep track of, managing revenue and budget, keep track of
  orders, taking decisions when it comes to stock control, and acting as a focal point of contact, but that didn't stop
  me from using my hobby at the time by creating various C# desktop applications that acts
  as helpers along with our POS system.

## Languages

* ### Arabic
  Native
* ### English
  Very good (_Writing - Reading_)
